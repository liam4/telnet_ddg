# Telnet DuckDuckGo server

![Demo](demo.png)

Want to try it? Don't hesitate!

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/liam4/telnet_ddg
$ npm install
$ node telnet.js # have this running in the background
```

```bash
$ telnet localhost 9444
# DuckDuckGo at your telnet command line
```

If you don't like the port `9444` you can set a new one as an argument to telnet.js:

```bash
$ node telnet.js 1337
```
